= Introduction =

The Instinct FAQ is under constructions.

= Why another testing framework? =

  * It's not a testing framework, it's a BDD framework :)
  * Includes mocks directly into the lifecycle


= Isn't unit testing a poor man's formal proof? =

Yes. However lots of people use Java

= Why does Instinct use JMock and not EasyMock? =

Rather than inventing one from scratch, Instinct bundles a mocking library called [http://www.jmock.org/ JMock]. JMock was chosen for the following reasons:

  * JMock expectations can be loosened up more than EasyMock. For example consider expecting that the test subject calls either {{{String.replace()}}} or {{{String.replaceAll()}}} (but not both).
  * The EDSL nature of JMock makes it clear that you're not calling code on the real class but instead writing expectations.
  * It's record/replay mode adds an extra line to every test.

However, EasyMock does offer

  * It is handy in IDEs with method completion
