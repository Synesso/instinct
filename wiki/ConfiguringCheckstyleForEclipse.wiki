1. Ensure that you have setup the plugin as per [CheckstyleForEclipse]

2. We need to generate a checkstyle configuration file for eclipse. If a file named {{{checkstyle-main-eclipse.xml}}} exists in the {{{installation_dir/core/etc/checkstyle/}}} directory, then delete it. Open command prompt and run 
{{{
./build.sh setup-eclipse
}}} 
on Linux or 

{{{
build.cm setup-eclipse
}}} 
on Windows.

from the {{{installation_dir/core}}} directory. This will create a file called {{{checkstyle-main-eclipse.xml}}} within {{{installation_dir/core/etc/checkstyle}}} directory.
