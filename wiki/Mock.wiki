#summary How to create mocks in your specifications

= Mocks =

Mocks are more advanced stubs, that not only respond to calls made during a test but are also pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive. Mocks will throw an exception if they receive a call they werenâ€™t expecting and are checked (called verification) to ensure they received all the calls they expected. Some mocks also verify the order of calls made.
