= Central Repository =

Instinct is not currently in the central Maven repository, the [http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MAVENUPLOAD-2170 upload request] is in progress. In the interim, you can obtain Instinct by manually specifying a repository (shown below).

= Manually Specifying a Repository =

You can download Instinct from the Instinct Maven repository by adding the following to your `pom.xml`:

{{{
<project>
  ...
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>instinct-repository</id>
      <url&gthttp://instinct.googlecode.com/svn/artifacts/maven/</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
  ...
</project>
}}}
