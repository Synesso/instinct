#summary Introduction to Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) with Instinct
#labels Tutorial

= Introduction =

This tutorial gives a simple introduction to Instinct. The examples for this tutorial come from the [http://instinct.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/instinct-example/ example project], full details are available there.

= Basic Usage =

Instinct is oriented around specifications of behaviour, that is, you expect the object under test (the *subject*) to behave in a certain manner. Instinct allows you to specify that in the same way as traditional unit testing frameworks such as JUnit.

Specifications are the methods that 


Behaviour contexts give you a way of grouping specifications that operate within a common context together. For example, a stack object may have many different states, empty, full, half-full, etc. You could 



Each behaviour context should represent a particular context of the test subject, like our full stack example from above. You are encouraged to use more than one behaviour context per test subject, perhaps even within the same class file.



= Specification Lifecycle =

TODO - before spec, after spec


= Mocking =

= Integrating with Ant =

Instinct comes with an Ant task (for which you'll need the main Ant 1.7.0 Jar in your classpath).


{{{
<target name="-run-specs" depends="-compile">
    <taskdef name="instinct" classname="com.googlecode.instinct.integrate.ant.InstinctAntTask" classpathref="spec.class.path"/>
    <instinct failureproperty="specs-failed">
        <specifications dir="${spec.classes.dir}"/>
        <formatter type="brief"/>
    </instinct>
    <fail if="${specs-failed}" message="Specifications failed"/>
</target>
}}}



Specifications are currently found only based on annotations.

Supported output formats are:

  * brief - Each behaviour context is listed on a single line, with a summary of all its contained specifications, e.g. {{{[instinct] Behaviour context: AFullStack, Specifications run: 1, Successes: 1, Failures: 0, Time elapsed: 0.0050 seconds}}}
  * verbose - A summary of each context is printed (similar to the brief output) followed by details of each of the contained specifications. Failures include the full stack trace of the failure, making output quite verbose.

{{{
