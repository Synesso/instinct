#summary Instinct Overview

= Introduction =

Instinct is a Driven Development ([http://behaviour-driven.org/ BDD]) framework for Java. Inspired by [http://rspec.rubyforge.org/ RSpec], Instinct provides flexible annotation of contexts, specifications, mocks, etc. (via Java 1.5 annotations, marker interfaces or naming conventions); automatic creation of mocks, stubs, test subjects & unique fields; a verification API (similar to JUnit's Assert); unique utilities; and JUnit test runner integration.

Instinct is designed to support developers as they develop
