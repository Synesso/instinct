= Introduction =

Instinct is a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework for Java. Inspired by RSpec, Instinct provides flexible annotation of contexts, specifications, actors, etc. (via Java 1.5 annotations, marker interfaces or naming conventions); automatic creation of test doubles (dummies, mocks & stubs) & test subjects; state and behavioural (mocks) expectation API; JUnit test runner integration & Ant tasks.

Instinct is primarily designed to support developers as they are developing code, as an integral part of the act of programming. Instinct specifications also serve as a means of critiquing production code, in a similar manner to more traditional testing frameworks such as JUnit or TestNG.
