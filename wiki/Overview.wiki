= Introduction =

Instinct is a Behaviour Driven Development ([http://behaviour-driven.org/ BDD]) framework for Java. Inspired by [http://rspec.rubyforge.org/ RSpec], Instinct provides flexible annotation of contexts, specifications, mocks, etc. (via Java 1.5 annotations, marker interfaces or naming conventions); automatic creation of test doubles (dummies, mocks & stubs) & test subjects; a verification API (similar to JUnit's Assert); and JUnit test runner integration.

Instinct is primarily designed to support developers as they are developing code, as an integral part of the act of programming. Instinct specifications also serve as a means of critiquing production code, in a similar manner to more traditional testing frameworks such as JUnit or TestNG.
