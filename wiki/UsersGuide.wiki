= Introduction =

Instinct is a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework for Java. Inspired by RSpec, Instinct provides flexible annotation of contexts, specifications and actors; automatic creation of test doubles and test subjects; a state and
behaviour expectation API; JUnit test runner integration; Ant support and an IntelliJ IDEA plugin.

Instinct is primarily designed to support developers as they are developing code, as an integral part of the act of programming. Instinct specifications also serve as a means of critiquing production code, in a similar manner to more traditional testing frameworks such as JUnit or TestNG.
